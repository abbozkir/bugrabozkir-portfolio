      "summary": "During my time at VodafoneZiggo, I actively contributed to the development of a NaaS solution as a back-end engineer, leveraging Java, Maven, and Amdocs' NEO platform. I independently learned and utilized the Robot Framework for API testing, ensuring the solution's reliability and seamless integration with various environments. Also used this experience to create E2E tests with Browser library (using Playwright) for the platform we use to ensure stability.\n\nWorking in an agile environment, I collaborated closely with teams, embracing effective communication and problem-solving to deliver successful outcomes. Using technologies like AWS, Kubernetes, Drool rules, and Postman, I gained valuable experience in cloud infrastructure and rule-based logic. Collaborating effectively with teams, I delivered reliable results and developed a passion for frontend development.\n\nI went beyond by taking the initiative by creating a developer tool as a browser extension with React.JS to make a developer's life easier and this was highly appreciated by developers and eventually by the management."

I was responsible for the development of two microservices, Workspace, and Schedule services, delivering crucial capabilities. Using technologies like MongoDB for data storage, RabbitMQ for event handling, and Swagger for code documentation, we ensured the reliability and scalability of the solution.\n\nAdditionally, I excelled as a frontend developer for the submarine sensor tracking and validating project for The Turkish NAVY, contributing my skills and dedication for the last 2 years. This project allowed me to enhance my proficiency in frontend technologies (including React, Redux, Axios, D3, and more) and offered valuable insights into creating intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.\n\nIn the R&D Department, I contributed to the development of RESTful endpoints for the Technology Management System, an internal tool used for command control solutions in the military field. We followed a monolith structure, employing the Spring Framework, Maven, Hibernate, MySQL, and Tomcat for back-end development. On the front-end, we utilized an in-house JavaScript framework."
